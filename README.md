## Introduction
In this project, we will explore the game-playing of Gobblet, Gobblet is an abstract game
played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on
top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.
The project is fully implemented using Python language with PyGame.

## Game Description
The goal in Gobblet is to place four of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed
piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other
spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece
being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a row
where your opponent has three of his color.
Your memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is
covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four like-colored pieces in a row,
he wins â€” except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that
finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its
starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in
that row, the game continues..

Components
16-square playing board
12 white Gobblets
12 black Gobblets

## Game Modes
The game has 3 modes with different difficulty levels:
| Game Mode |
| --- |
| Player vs Player  |
| Player vs AI |
| AI vs AI |

this mode (Player vs AI) has 2 difficulty levels:
| Difficulty Level | 
| --- |
| Easy |
| Hard |

and this mode (AI vs AI) has 4 difficulty levels:
| Difficulty Level | 
| --- |
| Easy vs Hard |
| Hard vs Easy |
| Easy vs Easy |
| Hard vs Hard |

## Algorithms

### Game-Palying Algorithms

The game algorithms used in this project are:

1. The minimax algorithm: a basic search algorithm that examines all possible moves from a given position and selects the move that leads to the best outcome for the current player


### Heuristics

## The GUI

The GUI is implemented using PyGame and includes the following main
Features: 
 - Board: Display the current game board and the current pieces on the board.
 - Move input: Allow human players to input their moves by clicking on the board .
 - Game status: Whose turn it is, and if the game is over.
 - Game options: Allow players to choose different game modes (e.g., human vs.
   human, human vs. computer, computer vs. computer), choose the AI player
   difficulty level (for each AI player), and start/restart a new game.
